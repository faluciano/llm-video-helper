What that means is I combine my loves of math, or I should say, maths, and magic to do what I call mathemagics. But before I get started, I've got a quick question for the audience.  By any chance, did anyone here in the audience happen to bring with them this afternoon a calculator? If you have one, perhaps on your phone or somewhere, and you're pretty comfortable using it, raise your hand. I'll need a couple of\n",

I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. I'll do 37,000 squared plus 691 squared plus...  37,000 times 691 times 2. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now let me explain one more thing. While I do this calculation, you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation. Let me explain what\n",
      "\n",
      "-----506----creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is.  This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use that allows me to convert numbers into words. I store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated. It's not. I just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of Rain Man here. There's definitely a method to my madness. Definitely, definitely. Sorry.  One last instruction for my judges with calculators. Now, who's got an answer in front of them?\n",

If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is. Just say you're close or something, and I'll try and figure it out, which can be pretty entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourselves.  Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right because this is my big finish, okay? So without any more stalling, here we go.\n",

I'll take advantage of that. Now, 700 times 37 is 25,900. 37 times 9 is 333. Subtract the two to get 25,567. 25,000. Do I believe that? Yeah, 25,567. Double that to get 52.  51,134. 51,134. Okay. 51,000 becomes light tomorrow. Light tomorrow is 51,134. That seems right. I'll go on. Next I do 37 squared, which is 1369. So I can say 1 billion. Take the\n",

So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size. Let's create a five-digit number. How about we go... Why don't we just go up this aisle? The first five people along the aisle, each give me a single digit. That will be my five-digit number. Three. Three.  Seven.\n",

I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. I'll do 37,000 squared plus 691 squared plus...  37,000 times 691 times 2. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now let me explain one more thing. While I do this calculation, you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation. Let me explain what\n",

      "-----506----creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is.  This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use that allows me to convert numbers into words. I store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated. It's not. I just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of Rain Man here.

If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is. Just say you're close or something, and I'll try and figure it out, which can be pretty entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourselves.  Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right because this is my big finish, okay?

I'll take advantage of that. Now, 700 times 37 is 25,900. 37 times 9 is 333. Subtract the two to get 25,567. 25,000. Do I believe that? Yeah, 25,567. Double that to get 52.  51,134. 51,134.

So let's take an example. How would you multiply 36 by 11? Now, if you solve it with the method you learn in school, then this problem is easy, but a little longer. But if you use this trick, like write 3 and 6 and in the center, add these two numbers, that is 396, which is the answer. See, lightning fast. Yeah, this is really basic, but\n",

So let us try another 42 multiply by 11, which is 462.  as fast as that see in here you are faster than a calculator now you will say this trick will only work if these two numbers add up to 9 if they add up to 10 what will happen then so let us do 37 x 11 what will happen then so 3 and at the end it is 7 and 7 plus 3 is 10 so that 1 goes on to carry so 407  This is our answer, so this is how fast you can do it.

You will say that you are just sharing tricks for specific number which will only work like for 11 and for other numbers. This is not mental math.

You will be able to divide 2 digit numbers upto 2 decimal places and a lot more. Now, the trick that I have taught you also works with 3 digit numbers multiplied by 11. So, let's take an example 4 23 multiplied by 11. So, 4, 4 plus 2, 6, 2 plus 3, 5 and 3. This is our answer.  Also, if there are carries, you just take the carry like we\n",

So our second trick is multiplying any two digit number ending in 5. So now you have just multiplied 75 into 75 in your head and I guess it would be really difficult for you if you don't know this trick. And the trick is that multiply 7 by its next number like 7 8's are 56 and the answer ends in 25. So 5625 is our answer. As simple as that.  Let's take some other examples. 45 x 45.\n",

I just want to tell you that I have added this 75 x 75 problem in my game MathLobran. And people were like, how will we do it in 3 seconds? But here we are doing it in 1 second. Now, the biggest number you can do with this trick is 95 x 95. That is 95 squared.  So, the answer is, you tell, yes, 9 into 10, 90, 25. As simple as that,\n",

For example, 34 multiply by 36. 4ths are 12 and 6 4ths are 24. 12, 24 is our answer. So, now let's take another example. 57 multiply by 53. Now, you do it.

This is a super thick book that people use to take Calculus 1, 2, and 3 in colleges in the US and in Canada. Once you have the book, you have to decide what section you want to read. My advice is to pick something that you want to read, so something that  is interesting to you, but at the same time, you wanna pick something that is going to push you a little bit. You want to study something that you really haven't\n",

You wanna push yourself into that uncomfortable place so that learning actually takes place. After all, the whole point is to actually learn something. Now it's time to set the timer. I like to set it for one hour. I feel like one hour is a good amount of time to study most subjects, and then you just get started.  So you start reading the book. You notice that it gives you the definition of the\n",

      "-----509----notice that it gives you the definition of the hyperbolic functions. So the first thing you want to do is make sure you know that definition. So how do you do that? Well, the best way to do that is to actually write down the definition. And you want to be able to write it down without looking at the book. For example, the hyperbolic sine of x, or sinh x, is going to be half the difference of e to the x and e to the negative x. So you take e to the x, you subtract e to the negative x, and you divide by 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "-----510----e to the negative x, and you divide by 2. The hyperbolic cosine  is going to be the average of e to the x and e to the negative x. So you take e to the x, you add e to the negative x, and you divide by 2. And for the rest of them, if you notice in the formulas, they're very similar to the trig functions. So you can go on from there and fill in the rest of the formulas for your hyperbolic functions. If you find yourself having to look at the book, you want to start over and do everything without looking at\n",

For example, here you notice they give you the hyperbolic identities, and they have a proof of one of them. So maybe prove the one they do, but do it on your own without looking at their solution, and maybe do a couple more just for practice. Then you continue reading the text and doing all of the examples that you can. Not everything\n",

      "-----511----all of the examples that you can. Not everything will make sense, and that's normal. And you want to just work through it and try to understand as much as you can from the examples that are given in the book. Once you get to the exercises, you should feel pretty good about yourself because you made it through the entire section.  At this point, you should start doing as many problems as you can. In a book like this, you'll have answers to most of the odd-numbered problems, which really helps. One thing you\n",

      "-----508----problems, which really helps. One thing you will notice in most math books is when you get to the problems at the end of a section, you're gonna find problems for which there are no examples in the book. So you wonder, how am I supposed to figure those out? Well, that's when you have to go back to the section and try to find information that you can use to help you solve those problems. If you still can't figure them out, it's okay.  Books like this have tons of problems and some of them are harder than\n",

      "-----511----tons of problems and some of them are harder than others. And if you're wondering why the author didn't include examples of every single type in the book, it's because then the book would be insanely huge. So they have to pick and choose what content they present in the book. So now you're done studying. You should feel good about yourself. You got a lot done. And this is the last step. It's to reflect. Reflect on what you did. Reflect on how meaningful your time was. You just took an hour of your life and\n",

You can stack it up in a big stack or you can throw it away. Whatever you like. As the day proceeds, you're going to find yourself thinking about some of the math you did.

Personally, I prefer pencils, but if you're a pen person,  This one's pretty incredible, although it is a little bit pricey. Of course, everyone needs a sharpener, and I like having one that's pretty good. This one doesn't use batteries, so I can take it with me.

This is a really simple one that works great, and it uses one AA battery. Of course, you can't do math unless you have something to write on, and this is paper. Notice this paper doesn't have lines.

This is a super thick book that people use to take Calculus 1, 2, and 3 in colleges in the US and in Canada. Once you have the book, you have to decide what section you want to read.

You wanna push yourself into that uncomfortable place so that learning actually takes place. After all, the whole point is to actually learn something. Now it's time to set the timer. I like to set it for one hour. I feel like one hour is a good amount of time to study most subjects, and then you just get started.  So you start reading the book. You notice that it gives you the definition of the\n",

      "-----509----notice that it gives you the definition of the hyperbolic functions. So the first thing you want to do is make sure you know that definition. So how do you do that? Well, the best way to do that is to actually write down the definition. And you want to be able to write it down without looking at the book. For example, the hyperbolic sine of x, or sinh x, is going to be half the difference of e to the x and e to the negative x. So you take e to the x, you subtract e to the negative x, and you divide by 2.\n",

      "-----510----e to the negative x, and you divide by 2. The hyperbolic cosine  is going to be the average of e to the x and e to the negative x. So you take e to the x, you add e to the negative x, and you divide by 2. And for the rest of them, if you notice in the formulas, they're very similar to the trig functions. So you can go on from there and fill in the rest of the formulas for your hyperbolic functions. If you find yourself having to look at the book, you want to start over and do everything without looking at\n",

For example, here you notice they give you the hyperbolic identities, and they have a proof of one of them. So maybe prove the one they do, but do it on your own without looking at their solution, and maybe do a couple more just for practice. Then you continue reading the text and doing all of the examples that you can. Not everything\n",

      "-----511----all of the examples that you can. Not everything will make sense, and that's normal. And you want to just work through it and try to understand as much as you can from the examples that are given in the book. Once you get to the exercises, you should feel pretty good about yourself because you made it through the entire section.  At this point, you should start doing as many problems as you can. In a book like this, you'll have answers to most of the odd-numbered problems, which really helps. One thing you\n",

      "-----508----problems, which really helps. One thing you will notice in most math books is when you get to the problems at the end of a section, you're gonna find problems for which there are no examples in the book. So you wonder, how am I supposed to figure those out? Well, that's when you have to go back to the section and try to find information that you can use to help you solve those problems. If you still can't figure them out, it's okay.  Books like this have tons of problems and some of them are harder than\n",

And if you're wondering why the author didn't include examples of every single type in the book, it's because then the book would be insanely huge. So they have to pick and choose what content they present in the book. So now you're done studying. You should feel good about yourself. You got a lot done. And this is the last step. It's to reflect. Reflect on what you did. Reflect on how meaningful your time was. You just took an hour of your life and\n",

But you can find success, which you need, okay, if you're willing to put in the work and do all the, you know, your part.

But if you want great grades in math,  You must learn how to take great math notes. So start improving your notes and everything will start getting better. OK, so let's get into these two equations. They look similar. OK, but they are quite different. Of course, I'm going to solve both of these here in a second. But let's go down and take a look at what's going on here. OK, well, first thing is this. All\n",
      "\n",
      "-----507----going on here. OK, well, first thing is this. All right. Before you do anything, you need to be able to identify what type of equations we're dealing with here.  So this first equation, x squared is equal to 10, is a what? Well, hopefully you recognize that as a quadratic equation. So this is the kind of stuff you study like in Algebra 1. So what can you tell me about quadratic equations? I'm just asking you. So put some of your answers into the comments section. How do we solve quadratic equations? So\n",
      "\n",
      "-----510----section. How do we solve quadratic equations? So that's a question for you. The second thing is how many solutions does a quadratic equation have?  All right, so let's go ahead and just answer this right now. So quadratic equations will always have two solutions, always, always, always. Sometimes they're going to be real number solutions or imaginary number solutions, but they're always going to have two solutions. Now, how we solve quadratic equations, well, there's all kinds of different techniques, and\n",
      "\n",
      "-----507----there's all kinds of different techniques, and this is stuff, again, you should have mastered in Algebra 1. You probably are reviewing this already like in the college algebra course, but  Sometimes you can take the square root of both sides. Sometimes you can factor. Sometimes you have to use the quadratic formula. Then there's something called completing the square. So there's quite a bit of different techniques involved in solving quadratic equations. Okay, so these are some, just right here is just\n",
      "\n",
      "-----503----Okay, so these are some, just right here is just some basic overviews of quadratic equations. So let's go ahead and solve this. And we have x squared is equal to 10. So the easiest way to solve this is simply to take the square root of both sides. So the square root of x squared  is x and the square root of 10. Now here we're not talking about the principal square root. We're going to be talking about the plus or minus version. So the square root of 10 is plus or minus the square root of 10. So for\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----10 is plus or minus the square root of 10. So for example, if I took the square root of 4, the answer is going to be plus or minus 2. Why? Because positive 2 times positive 2 is positive 4. And negative 2 times negative 2 is also a positive 4.  These are our two solutions here, both positive and negative. Remember, quadratic equations have two solutions. So over here, our two solutions would be what? Well, one solution is going to be positive square root of 10, and our second solution is negative square\n",
      "\n",
      "-----511----of 10, and our second solution is negative square root of 10. So instead of writing it this way, positive square root of 10, negative square root of 10, it's pretty common just to write this notation plus or minus right here. It just saves us for having us to write  two unique solutions but just remember there are two unique solutions to this quadratic equation all right so if you got that right that's excellent and give you a little check mark here so now let's talk about this equation okay so what are we\n",
      "\n",
      "-----502----talk about this equation okay so what are we talking about here you can see I have it abbreviated well this in this particular equation the variable is an exponent okay so down here  This x was down in the base. All right. And we recognize this as a polynomial to degree two. But here, the variable that we're looking for is in the exponent. So we would classify this as an exponential equation because this is an exponential equation. If you knew that, that's excellent. So how do we solve exponential\n",
      "\n",
      "-----509----that's excellent. So how do we solve exponential equations? OK, well, you need to use something called logarithms. OK, so when we see an exponential equation, we're going to have to use logarithms to solve it.  When we see a logarithmic equation, we're going to have to use exponents to solve logarithmic equations because exponential functions and logarithmic functions are inverse functions of one another, okay? So you're going to have to know both of these when you're at that college algebra, algebra two\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----when you're at that college algebra, algebra two level. Okay, so I kind of gave you some hints here, all right? This is an exponential equation, and you're going to be using logarithms to solve. So just in case you forgot that,  And you're like, okay, now I remember that. Well, then let me go ahead and see, do this problem. Go ahead and pause the video and solve for x. Okay, so we know how to do this. This will take you about 30 seconds. But I'm going to go ahead and do this now. All right, so the first\n",
      "\n",
      "-----509----go ahead and do this now. All right, so the first thing we want to do is just take the log of both sides, the logarithms of both sides. I want to go log 2x is equal to log 10. Now, if you go into your calculator, okay,  you put in log 2 log 2 you'll see that this is just a number itself log 10 is just a number in and of itself so these are just numbers okay so let me just write this right make this much clearer okay so I'm taking the log of both sides now I want to solve for x so what we need to now know\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----I want to solve for x so what we need to now know is a property of logarithms so I have a problem I don't have personally the property there is a problem  property that says that we can drop this variable this little exponent in front of the log this is how we unlock this solution so I'm going to take this X and rewrite it down here X log 2 is equal to log 10 okay all right now again if I use my calculator log 2 is just a decimal I can find on my calculator same thing with log 10 okay this is called the\n",
      "\n",
      "-----510----same thing with log 10 okay this is called the common logarithm  I'm skipping a lot of stuff here. I'm not really talking about what a logarithm is, etc. But really, what you need to know is logarithms are powerful. They allow us to solve exponential equations. And you'll need your calculator for most problems. Okay, so we have x times a number. Again, this is a decimal. So x times some number is equal to another number. So how do I solve for x? Well, I just simply divide both sides of the equation by log\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----simply divide both sides of the equation by log 2.  And so x is going to be equal to log 10 divided by log 2. Of course, I can go into my calculator and get that actual decimal, and you'll get the right answer. But let's take a look at x to the 10th power, or 2x to the 10th power. So this is the real power of logarithms. So let's say we didn't know logarithms, and we're like, hmm, 2 to what power is 10?  Well, is it two to the first? No, because two to the first is four. So let's increase our power. How\n",
      "\n",
      "-----509----first is four. So let's increase our power. How about two squared? All right. I'm sorry. Two to the first is two. Excuse me. OK, see, I made a mistake, but I caught myself. Right. So two to the first is two. That's not going to work. Two squared is four. OK, I'm looking for two to what power is ten. OK, so I'm just kind of going up here. I'm like two to the first is two. Two squared is four.  How about 2 cubed? Well, that's 2 times 2 times 2, 2 times 2 times 2, which is, of course, 4 times 2, which is 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----2, which is, of course, 4 times 2, which is 8. So that's pretty close, right? 2 cubed is 8, so I want 10. So I'm going to have to increase from 3, right? So let's go down here, and I go 2 to the fourth power, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. So this is 4 times 4, which is now 16, okay? So  2 to the 4th, you know, puts me way over the top. I want 10. I don't want 16. So 2 cubed is a little bit closer to 10. Okay, so what does that tell us? Well, you can just kind of estimate this. You can be like, oh,\n",
      "\n",
      "-----511----just kind of estimate this. You can be like, oh, hey, use your calculator, 2 to the 3.5, see what decimal you get. But your final answer here would be somewhere around 2 to the 3 point, maybe 1. I don't have my calculator in front of me, but you kind of get the idea.  To solve these equations and get the actual specific exact answer, you need logarithms. So when you go into your calculator and you perform this operation, you'll get that exact decimal. But you can see how powerful logarithms are. All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "-----508----can see how powerful logarithms are. All right. But remember, if you're at the college algebra level, algebra two level, you know, any, you know, more than just a first year algebra level in terms of your mathematics.  you have to be able to identify what type of equations you're working with. That's the first thing, because some equations look similar, and sometimes students confuse one for the other.
