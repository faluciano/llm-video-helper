 Hello Geniuses! Till the end of this video, you will be able to do any of these problems in just a snap, faster than a calculator. So, let's begin! So, welcome to this first part of MathoGenius Mental Math series.  In this series, I will teach you how to do lightning fast calculations in snap and which will amaze your friends and also help you academically a lot. So let's start with one of the most basic but really impressive math trick. This trick is also really famous, so I guess most of you will already know it. But let me teach you that first. So the trick is two digit multiplication with 11. This is a really basic trick.  So let's take an example. How would you multiply 36 by 11? Now, if you solve it with the method you learn in school, then this problem is easy, but a little longer. But if you use this trick, like write 3 and 6 and in the center, add these two numbers, that is 396, which is the answer. See, lightning fast. Yeah, this is really basic, but yeah, this is a cool trick too. So let us try another 42 multiply by 11, which is 462.  as fast as that see in here you are faster than a calculator now you will say this trick will only work if these two numbers add up to 9 if they add up to 10 what will happen then so let us do 37 x 11 what will happen then so 3 and at the end it is 7 and 7 plus 3 is 10 so that 1 goes on to carry so 407  This is our answer, so this is how fast you can do it. Now if you are really new in mental math, I know you will have a little problem in taking this carry. But trust me, as you go on this series, this will be a piece of cake for you. Now I know what you are thinking. You will say that you are just sharing tricks for specific number which will only work like for 11 and for other numbers. This is not mental math. Yes, in this video, I am just teaching some basic tricks to you because this is the first part. But as we move on to this course,  You will learn how to multiply 2 3 digit numbers. You will be able to memorize the first 24 digits of Pi. You will be able to divide 2 digit numbers upto 2 decimal places and a lot more. Now, the trick that I have taught you also works with 3 digit numbers multiplied by 11. So, let's take an example 4 23 multiplied by 11. So, 4, 4 plus 2, 6, 2 plus 3, 5 and 3. This is our answer.  Also, if there are carries, you just take the carry like we have done in the previous problem. So, let's take an example. 473 multiply by 11. So, see, 4 and 7 plus 4 is 11. So, 4 will change into 5. So, 5, 1 and 7 plus 3 is 10. So, 5, 2, 0, 3. This is our answer. As simple as that. See, you are here also faster than a calculator.  So just after these two tricks, you are able to multiply any two digit number or any three digit number by 11. So this is how cool mental math is. So now let's take it to a next level. I have a question for you. Multiply 75 by 75 in your head right now and note that time.  So our second trick is multiplying any two digit number ending in 5. So now you have just multiplied 75 into 75 in your head and I guess it would be really difficult for you if you don't know this trick. And the trick is that multiply 7 by its next number like 7 8's are 56 and the answer ends in 25. So 5625 is our answer. As simple as that.  Let's take some other examples. 45 x 45. So, 4 x 5 is 20. 2 x 0 is 25. 15 x 15. 1 x 2 is 2. 2 x 25. As simple as that. See, we are faster than a calculator in here also. I just want to tell you that I have added this 75 x 75 problem in my game MathLobran. And people were like, how will we do it in 3 seconds? But here we are doing it in 1 second. Now, the biggest number you can do with this trick is 95 x 95. That is 95 squared.  So, the answer is, you tell, yes, 9 into 10, 90, 25. As simple as that, we have just done it in a snap. Now, this same trick also works with numbers which have same starting digit and the ending digits are adding to 10. For example, 34 multiply by 36. 4ths are 12 and 6 4ths are 24. 12, 24 is our answer. So, now let's take another example. 57 multiply by 53. Now, you do it.  Yes, 6 5s are 30 and 7 3s are 21. 30, 21, as simple as that. Now, the most important thing you need in this course to become a super fast mental math calculator is practice. It is really important. If you don't practice, these videos are just a waste for you.  So I can just throw some practice problems to you right now. But I know most of you won't do it. Like 90% of you won't do those practice problems. So it won't help. So that's why I made this free game. Which will help you practice mental math. Its name is Math Blob Run. In this game there is a bad blob who is chasing a good blob. And you have to solve mental math questions to save our good blob. And make a high score in it.  So it is a fun game which will help you practice mental math. So thanks for watching this video and see you in the next mental math series video. And always remember that math is everything.
